# 248. Strobogrammatic Number III

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/strobogrammatic-number-iii/)

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.

For example,  
Given low = "50", high = "100", return 3\. Because 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.

**Note:**  
Because the range might be a large number, the _low_ and _high_ numbers are represented as string.
