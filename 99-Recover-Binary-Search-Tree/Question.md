# 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/)

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

**Note:**  
A solution using O(_n_) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?
